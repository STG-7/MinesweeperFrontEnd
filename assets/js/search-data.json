            "content": "Submission #1 . Reporting Category | Student Score | CB Score | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | In the 14 second video, I thought the program showed the input (the command being executed) and the output of the program which was a table of values ​​for each side of a triangle. The description also explained the features of the program. The College Board, in its statement giving this submission a 0 in this category, said of the response &quot;does not indicate the purpose of the program&quot;. This response received 0 because CB returns 0 if any part of the request is missing. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There were two code segments, the name of the variable representing the list was used in the explanation, and the submission explained what data was in the page list and what role it played in the program. Without this list and its data, the program would not have worked. The College Board agreed with this score. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The filing description does not mention how the named list (sideIndex) manages program complexity. CB agreed with this rating and gave the submission her 0/1 in this rating category. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student-developed procedure is ratioCalculate, and there is a student-developed procedure and another code segment that calls the procedure. In the description, the filing also explains how this her RatioCalculate procedure contributes to the program&#39;s functionality. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The description has a program code segment describing the ratioCalculate algorithm developed by the student, which includes all the CB requirements. The explanation is very descriptive in relation to this algorithm, which is why CB gave the submission 1/1 in this category as well. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | It got a 1/1. This is because the description shows two calls to the procedure with different arguments and states the conditions tested for each of those calls. Finally, since the responses indicated the outcome of each of these calls, CB met all the requirements of this section of the evaluation, similarly giving him a 1/1. | . . Submission #2 . Reporting Category | Student Score | CB Score | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | A video showing the program in action shows that there is user input from the user placing tiles in a grid, and output from how the game works. Here is the simulation in action: In the description, the submission states the program&#39;s purpose, the features shown in the video, and the program&#39;s inputs and outputs (explicitly written in the description). CB agreed with this rating and also gave it a rating of 1/1. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The description shows two different code segments that demonstrate how the data is persisted. Specify the name of the list (startGrid) and the contents of the list. It ticked all the boxes and gave it a 1/1 as did CB. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | In the explanation (3.b.v) the submission describes how the task becomes incredibly complex with the use of variables and other methods, and then how lists can be used to handle that complexity. About So I gave it a 1/1 and so did CB. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This discussion describes the replaceList procedure and how it contributes to the program&#39;s functionality and needs. So it won 1/1 and CB agreed.. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The submission describes the implementation of the replaceList method and the algorithm it contains. The explanation deserves 1/1 because it is very specific about the algorithms and steps it contains and ticks all the boxes. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Test scored 1/1 and CB agreed. This discussion describes two of her calls to procedures that contribute to the execution of various code segments in the program. This discussion also describes the conditions tested in relation to the procedure call and finally the results of his two calls to the procedure. | .",
